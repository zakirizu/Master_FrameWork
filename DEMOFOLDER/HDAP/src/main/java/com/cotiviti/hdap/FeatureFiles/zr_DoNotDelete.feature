##Before Hook (Specific to that Tag if present)-> Before Hook(Common to all. No Tag defined)->BackGround->SCENARIO-> AfterHook(Common to all)->AfterHook(Specific to that Tag)
#
##***********Hooks***********
## The difference between background and hooks is that . 
##Hooks code will run before every scenaios that is present in all the feature files. - Scope is to all features
##Background code will run before only those scenaios that is present in that feature file. - Scope is only that feature
## The code of background will run only for the that particular in which you have written the 
#
##    ***********BackGround*********************
#	- Steps present in this will run before every scenarios ,
#     The scope of the background is only for this feature, I mean the backgroung will run before every scenario present only in the feature
#
#Background: 
#	Given 			Clear the Cache 
#	#	Feature is collection of Scenarios 
#	#	#This example is to write the Plan Gherkin Language
#	#	This is from Legion

#Scenario: Login to the HDAP Application 
#	Given 			 I want to write a step with precondition 
#	And 				 some other precondition

#	****************Scenario Outline******************** 
#	Parametrizing the variables, In this case we need to pass the variable with 
#	syntax: "<variableName>" 
#	By this method we can only send the value as String. As we are passing the 
#	values in : "" 
#	To over come this we will be using the 
#	@scOutline @All 
#	Scenario Outline: Testing the Scenario o utline 
#	Given 			  Launch the url 
#	Then 			  Enter the "<userName>" and "<passWord>" 
#	Then 			  Close the browser 
#	
#	Examples: 
#	| userName | passWord |
#	| Zakir    | Rizu     					|
#	| Zoya     | Amyrah   			|
#	| Younus   | Ameena   	|

##	ScOutline with Regular Expression 
##	Regular Expression- By this way we can send anything in the Variable 
##	Syntax of Regular Expression: ^ (.+) (.+) $ -->In this example we are passing 
##	two variables 
##	If you could see, by use of the RegExp we can send both String, Integer and 
##	Char 
#	@scOutlineRegEx1 @All 
#	Scenario Outline: Testing the Scenario outline 
#	Given 			  Launch the url of the Application 
#	Then 			  Validate the <userName> and <passWord> in the Application 
#	Then 			  Application closure 
#	
#	Examples: 
#	| userName 	| passWord 	|
#	| Zakir    				| Rizu     				|
#	| Zoya     			| Amyrah   		|

#	
#	@ReadDataFromExcel222 
#	Scenario Outline: Testing where user is able to read data from the Excel Sheet 
#	Given   Read ExcelData from <SheetName> and <TestCaseID> 
#	Examples: 
#	
#	| SheetName | TestCaseID |
#	|alphaSheet |TestCasesID1|
#	|betaSheet |TestCasesID10|
#	|realTime| HighLightElement|
#	
#	
#	
#	**********************RUNNING THE TEST CASES INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING via TEST 
#	RUNNER FILE****************** 
#	If you want to run only specific test cases , Then   we can give the tags like 
#	Smoke, Sanity and Regression 
#	If you want run smoke and sanity , then include these tags in the test scenario 
#	also include the tags by using or in the test runner 
#	Run with or & And   
#	<Or> means this will run the test cases with either of the tags to that test 
#	cases 
#	<And> meand this will run test cases should have both the test cases for sure 
#	<Not> This will skip all the test cases which are having that tag for that test 
#	case
